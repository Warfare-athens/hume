    question: "How many sprays should I apply for festive occasions?",

  return [
    {
      heading: `How To Choose The Right ${entry.festivalName} Perfume`,
      text: `Choosing fragrance for ${entry.festivalName} starts with context, not trend. You need to map your scent profile to timing, venue, and how long you expect to stay out. In India, festive plans often begin in the day and continue into evening, so top notes alone are never enough. Start with a profile that opens clean and inviting, then confirm the base has enough body to survive heat, humidity, food aromas, and crowd movement. For ${entry.festivalName}, focus on notes like ${keywordLine}. These notes create emotional familiarity while still feeling premium. Also prioritize wearability: your fragrance should be noticeable at social distance but never suffocating in close family conversations. A strong festive scent is one that feels intentional, lasts through transitions, and still smells elegant in the final hour of your celebration.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Why Concentration Matters In Indian Weather",
      text: `A major reason people feel disappointed with festive perfumes is concentration mismatch. Many buyers unknowingly wear light EDT-style blends in demanding weather, then assume the fragrance is bad when performance drops in 2–3 hours. For festival days, an EDP profile is more practical because it holds structure under pressure. The objective is not to smell stronger at minute one; it is to smell consistent at hour six. If your calendar includes travel, outfit changes, crowded venues, and long ceremonies, you need a fragrance architecture that survives all of it. This means top-note sparkle supported by stable heart and base construction. During ${entry.festivalName}, look for compositions that begin clean, transition gracefully, and avoid harsh synthetic sharpness when skin heats up. That’s the difference between “good opening” and “all-day signature.”`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Daytime vs Evening Strategy",
      text: `Most festive fragrance mistakes happen because one scent is forced into every setting. A better strategy is to choose one profile that adapts naturally from day to evening. Daytime calls for clarity and polish; evening allows slightly deeper character. The easiest way to handle both is to pick a balanced scent family and modulate spray count. Use fewer sprays for rituals, family brunches, and close indoor moments. Add a controlled top-up before evening gatherings if needed. For ${entry.festivalName}, this approach helps you stay fresh without restarting the fragrance story completely. Think of your perfume as part of styling, just like fabric and accessories. It should support mood shifts throughout the day. In practical terms, that means avoiding extremely sharp freshies and extremely sweet bombs; choose the middle ground with structure, softness, and staying power.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Fragrance Pairing With Traditional And Modern Outfits",
      text: `Your perfume should complement fabric texture, color palette, and event mood. Rich traditional attire with embroidery and warm tones generally pairs better with amber, woods, spice, and soft resin notes. Lighter modern outfits or daytime pastel looks usually benefit from citrus-aromatic openings and clean musk trails. During ${entry.festivalName}, people move across multiple dress codes in a single day, so flexibility matters. If you can only wear one fragrance, pick a profile with smooth transitions rather than abrupt changes. A scent that starts crisp but settles into warm woods is usually safer than one-dimensional profiles. Fragrance pairing is also social positioning: your scent should communicate grooming and taste before anyone asks what you are wearing. That subtle impression is often more valuable than brute projection.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Projection, Compliments, And Social Comfort",
      text: `Compliment-worthy fragrance is rarely the loudest fragrance in the room. The best festive perfumes project just enough to be remembered but stay refined in close interactions. During ${entry.festivalName}, you’ll likely meet family, friends, elders, and new people across different settings, so social comfort should be a design rule. Avoid over-spraying sweet-heavy formulas that become dense indoors. Instead, target pulse points strategically and include one light fabric spray if your fragrance allows. This gives you a stable aura while reducing the risk of olfactory fatigue. Another practical tip: test your perfume in motion, not just in front of a mirror. Walk, sit, and re-enter the room after ten minutes. If it still feels elegant and controlled, you have the right performance profile for festive use.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Budget Logic: Luxury Feel Without Luxury Markup",
      text: `Festive seasons involve gifting, travel, outfits, and hosting costs, so fragrance budget discipline matters. Paying only for a label rarely improves experience if the profile does not suit climate and wear style. The better approach is value engineering: prioritize scent architecture, concentration, and how naturally the fragrance develops on skin. For ${entry.festivalName}, this lets you achieve premium impression without overspending. You can redirect savings toward gifting, accessories, or second-scent rotation. Practical buyers compare longevity per rupee, not just brand prestige. If a fragrance gives polished opening, smooth heart, and reliable base performance across 8–10 hours, it has already met the core luxury criteria that most users actually feel in real life.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Recommended Fragrance Styles For This Festival",
      text: `For ${entry.festivalName}, the strongest-performing styles are: ${styleLine}. These styles work because they handle crowd environments, mixed temperatures, and long wear windows without collapsing. You can choose fresh-aromatic blends when your schedule is daytime heavy, or shift toward woody-amber depth for evening-first plans. If your event includes photography, greeting lines, and indoor dining, balanced projection is essential. If your plans are mostly open-air and active, prioritize longer dry-down support. The recommendation products below are selected from HUME’s catalogue to match these festival-use conditions. They are meant to reduce guesswork: each option is practical for Indian wear, festive pacing, and real social settings where fragrance needs to perform beyond the first impression.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "How To Apply For 8–10 Hour Festive Performance",
      text: `Application technique can improve perceived performance as much as formula selection. Start with moisturized skin, then spray on neck sides, upper chest, and wrists. Do not rub, because friction disturbs top-note evaporation and can flatten evolution. If you wear layered outfits during ${entry.festivalName}, use one light spray on inner fabric (after patch test) to extend scent memory through movement. For evening extensions, add a single re-spray rather than restarting with multiple bursts. Store your bottle away from sunlight and heat to preserve quality across the season. These simple habits make a measurable difference in longevity, clarity, and projection consistency.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Mistakes To Avoid During Festival Wear",
      text: `Common festive mistakes include choosing a fragrance only by top-note test strip, over-spraying before entering crowded spaces, and mixing heavily scented personal care products with perfume. Another issue is copying someone else’s “best perfume” without matching it to your body chemistry and event type. For ${entry.festivalName}, avoid extremes: very sharp citrus with no base support, or very sweet dense formulas for daytime family rituals. Also avoid testing and buying on the same day if possible; give fragrances at least one full dry-down cycle. Smart selection is about stability, comfort, and memorability over time. When those three align, your scent supports your presence instead of competing with it.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Final Take: Build A Repeatable Festival Fragrance System",
      text: `The best way to win festive fragrance decisions is to treat them as a system: one versatile signature, one optional alternate profile, and a clear application method. This keeps choices simple while giving enough flexibility for changing plans. For ${entry.festivalName}, use the recommendation block below to shortlist products that fit real Indian conditions and social use-cases. From there, compare based on your preferred note direction, projected wear duration, and occasion mix. Done correctly, your perfume becomes a reliable style anchor across the entire festive calendar—not just a one-day purchase. That is how you turn fragrance from impulse buying into dependable personal branding.`,
